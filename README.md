# Facial Expression Detector
A machine learning approach to recognizing facial expressions using scikit and Python.

## Prerequisites
To be able to run this project, be sure to have a version of Python 3 installed. You will also need numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib installed to run this.
To install these packages, run one of the following depending on your operating system/installation of Python 3:
`python -m pip install scikit-learn numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas`
`python3 -m pip install scikit-learn numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas`
`pip install scikit-learn numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas`
`pip3 install scikit-learn numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas`

## Dataset
To be able to run this project, you must have the dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/murugappanm/facial-emotion-recognition-dataset](Kaggle).
Once you have this, create a directory in the project root called `datasets` and move it in there.

## Running
To run, run this command if you're on Windows: `python emotion_recognition.py`.
If you're on MacOS or Linux, run `python3 emotion_recognition.py`
